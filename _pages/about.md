<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I’m Nick, a second-year Ph.D. student in the Environmental, Civil, Agriculture and Mechanical(ECAM) program at the College of Engineering, University of Georgia (UGA). I'm working as a Research assistant in <a href="https://smil.engr.uga.edu/">Jidong, James Yang's lab</a>. My research primarily focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to address challenges in transportation. I am passionate about integrating computer vision algorithms with real-world applications to improve transportation efficiency, safety, and sustainability.

I graduated from <a href="https://english.bnu.edu.cn/"> Beijing Normal University</a>  with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in the Department of Statistics, advised by <a href="https://stat.bnu.edu.cn/english/faculty/facultydirectory/departmentofappliedstatistics/237292.html">Junlong Zhao (赵俊龙)</a>. After graduation, I worked as an automation testing engineer at Huawei for two years. During this time, I focused on developing image quality testing algorithms for AR-HUD system and designed an end-to-end integrated testing processes to ensure AR-HUD imaging quality. I successfully contributed to two AR-HUD projects, including Volkswagen's Rising 7 and BYD's Yangwang U8.
